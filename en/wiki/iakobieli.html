    <p><b>Son-of-God Iakobieli Yeshuasi</b> is the self-proclaimed Sovereign Prince of Georgia by divine right; moreover, the extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of მართ Sovereigndom of მართ God on earth; among other positions. Interestingly, according to the statement of Son-of-God Iakobieli: "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">i am not monarch, i am divine judge wholly bound to god's will appointed by god,</a>" "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">and i, according to father’s will, represent მართ just impartial truth;</a>" Furthermore, he has declared that: "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">now, i sovereign prince am, i am sovereign and i am lord; though, i chained am to god’s will; therefore, i at day’s end am extraordinary and plenipotentiary prince, made out visible by god.</a>" and "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">father made me comprehend, that though i will be titled-called sovereign prince, in reality i will become slave of everyone and, that tending to country, is მართ jarring responsibility.</a>" Son-of-God Iakobieli declares, that monarchy and hierocracy are contrary to the will of God, acclaims God as The Sovereign of Sovereigns and მართ Only Sovereign, and says that under theocracy the sovereign [prince] is subject to God.</p>
	<br>
    <p> Son-of-God Iakobieli Yeshuasi is the head of the house, "Yeshua Anointed-One's Son-of-God-ate." The house's belonging is New Saqarthvelo and მართ Sovereigndom of მართ God. The heir [to the headship] of the house is Son-of-God Abiya Iakobielison Yeshuasi.</p><br>
    <p> For the time, Son-of-God Iakobieli Yeshuasi is the place holder for the number of anathematized bishops; among them, to be noted: the First of All Bishops of Mcxetha, the First-of-Bishops of Jerusalem, the First-of-Bishops of Constantinople, the First-of-Bishops of Thbilisi, the First-of-Bishops of Afxazethi, the First-of-Bishops of Atchara, and the First-of-Bishops of Lazethi.</p><br>

	<br>
    <p> According to available information, the date of birth of Son-of-God Iakobieli is unknown; based on the poem "სა-grateful-ი", Son-of-God Iakobieli is of eighth December and he was sixteen in the summer of 2020; that is, he was probably born on December 8, 2003.</p>
    <p> According to the book-letter "georgians," "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">1. dream, which saw malkhaz-did, before hour-of child-of conception-of: was-made foreign saying-as: thou-name child name-as raven and he-will-be-given all-of most talent, will-be happiest. 2. before hour-of child-of birth-of, nona-did, wife malkhaz-of, mother child-of, wanted naming other name-of. malkhaz-did, he-told-her wife-to about it-of, which he saw and heard before child-of conception-of. called malkhaz-did child name-as raven. 3. hour-during newborn-of baptism-of, was-chosen name iakobi. was-baptized child and no-more was-named henceforth name-as raven, but iakobi.</a>"</p>
	<p> Information about the life of Son-of-God Iakobieli is too scanty to draw firm conclusions. According to the attitude expressed in Son-of-God Iakobieli's works, he does not recognize anyone as his father except God - "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">One is Father my მართ God.</a>"</p>
	<br>
	<p> Son-of-God Iakobieli has recognized only one, a member of own house and own descendant - Son-of-God Abiya Iakobielison Yeshuasi. There is no information about Son-of-God Abiya. In the letter "abiya-to", Son-of-God Iakobieli describes him as: "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">my obedient and deeply respecter; holy and lovefull; allradiant and kind; sharer food-of and drink-of; compassionate and allaffectionate; pleaser and imitator father-of; sayvareli{beloved&endearing}, virtuous, wise child; faceradiant and worthy, despicable nothing-with in eyes-of my-ones-of; who thirsts me water-than more-as, whoso feeds me-with relationship food-than more-as; abiya;</a>" and "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">my snow-as resplendent, lazurian, golden boy, holy-is this words mine thee toward written.</a>"</p>
	<p> It is known about Son-of-God Abiya, that he and Son-of-God Iakobieli met on December 29, 2020. Based on the books "abiya-to" and "suffer, die, rise, not-ear-cutter-ness-with, humility-with-ა and love-with: my-of testimony gods-on," they had to far, although the exact circumstances are unknown.</p>
	<p> Son-of-God Iakobieli writes extensively about their relationship in the above-mentioned books. Excerpts from the first book: "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">i-gave-thee მართ spirit, and i-was-given responsibility thee-on before god-of. intertwined-are spirits our, made-me-perceive god-did. holy-is our relationship and divine our love;</a>" "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">i-am-sorry every thee without away-passed second-of-for. i am wholly unreserved thee-for; our{inclusive} love our delight-is. . . . thee-for i-will-die and i-will-be-tortured, i-will-kill and i-will-torture. eachother-of-for already have-been-tortured-we; second every thee without me-pains. thee-for my body-of slowly dissecting-of pain in-i-would-feel and i-would-die; thee-for my self bronze-of bull-in in-i-would-let-be-thrown and its under fire up-i-would-let-be-lit - death-of before, how is-being-melted, is-being-burnt, is-being-roasted fervent bronze-on my flesh in-i-would-feel. thee-for hell-to myself-i-would-content.</a>" Also, it is noteworthy that when addressing Son-of-God Abiya, Son-of-God Iakobieli once uses the name "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">gio.</a>"</p>

He stated in the address "divine address to saqarthvelo": "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">to ecclesial persons: i nobody am without god; and exactly with comprehension of my soil-ness, way was given to grace of spiritholy and father with secret torment*{double emphasized} deified me. i and father, together, ineffably much suffered, and my will does not exist; მართ father’s will is my everything; i breathe, to be father’s heeding son; and not i, rather father, will protect me from any malicious allegation and my justification comes from father; i father’s son am, by father secretly privately in own beyond-all-loving-and-considering love grown.</a>"</p>

	<p> In the sixth part of the address, he made statements of the utmost importance on Right-Faith; they concern Mother of God, the saints, prayer, the character of God, the grace of the Holy Spirit, sentience, the true identity of human, the meaning of life through the cross, and non-Orthodox faith of Christ.</p> <details><summary><p style="color: #00053f;">Read more</p></p></summary>
					<p style="color: #618cb8;"> "to say saints' prayer has peculiar grace is wrong, for father impartially cares for everyone; and it's true, at times, he wills to work through his saints, to show men, that there is exaltedness in being set apart for him. . . . anyone who beholds god as distant and scary being, does not know him and his beyond-all-loving father’s affection towards us; for he delights in our every breath and, for he, out of his love, gave up his life for us, not because of anything we have done. . . . . in my father's sight, none sentient of his creatures merits standing above any other. . . . . by good struggle, you can give way to grace of god, but you can never do anything to earn it; there is no one righteous other than father and there is no salvation outside of him. by god’s decree, shall this be preached in churches by his priests, for his children to better know him; for indeed, all of them are seated with him, that is god, on divine throne in oneness of chirst and his church. apart from me, no good can you do. furthermore, know this, mother of god incarnate, before she was so, was daughter of god; and foremost is daughter of god and then bearer of god incarnate; she is of peculiar reverence, for her flesh is in part flesh of god incarnate and, as mother of sovereign, bears honorific title of queen or mother-lord. . . . if you think, that with your praying you will save someone or/and some saint’s prayer will save someone; hoi, not do you have knowing of god and are in delusion; even ineffable blasphemy in all-graceless lord-departer მართ sinful reasoning: you are as accursed ones, which cut icons into communion. . . . also, by god i want to clarify, to call mother of god queen as female sovereign or "vasilisa" is improper; for მართ title belongs to body of christ, church collectively. . . . . it is worth მართ difficulty to become whom god made you to be. . . . . and such is god’s will for your life; and if you are unwilling to spend yourselves everyday bearing your crosses by grace of god, having resigned yourselves completely over to father, trusting him accordingly; then you are living in sin and your faith is dead and your religion is vainness. . . . and if you are not confessing god according to rightfaith, then you believe in pigment of your imagination and are worshipper of satans and your christianness is false. . . . yet, i tell thee, not to believe me, rather seek god with all thine heart and with humbleness of heart; seek truth with willingness to accept truth as truth reveals own self. . . . christ bore cross, therefore in him we can too. . . . . and have nothing to do with those who profane father’s title, baselessly calling themselves christians, but are degrading and profaning sacraments of communion, marriage, priesthood, and countless other abominations before thrice-holy god; for they are accursed before him; and if any such will be found in church, indefinitely anathema be! *{how blind shall one be, to replace most holy of blood and of flesh communion, with 'cracker' and grape juice.} . . . these are who confess to be christ’s church, of pure preaching of gospel, and of christly sacramental life; but be not deceived, for though they claim christ, they have spat in მართ face of our savior and god; and their actions condemn them! these are those who confess they are orthodox, but are anathema before father!"</p>
					</details>
    <p> In the seventh part of the address, he declared: "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">i claim no recognition for any good, rather every good is gift from father. i am not good, rather of good. god is potter, but clay am. . . . "or make მართ tree well-acceptable and მართ its fruit well-acceptable, or make მართ tree rotten and მართ its fruit rotten; for from მართ fruit, comes-to-knowledge მართ tree.". . .  spiritholy in me witnesses, that i am his; other proving is insult of spiritholy; "every sovereigndom split against own is trampled over, and every city or house split against own will not stand."</a>"</p>
	<p> In the ninth part of the address, he made statements of the utmost importance on Right-Faith: they touched on the question of "if children go to heaven," ritual purity, debt, the signing of the cross, the protection of holiness, the merely wayward standing of non-Orthodox. He then rebuked the then Exarch of Australia on vaccines, [by God] summoned for the future a Ecumenical [Ecclesial] Council, and addressed "many people, which in last period found themselves under press of sorrow."</p> <details><summary><p style="color: #00053f;">Read more</p></p></summary>
					<p style="color: #618cb8;"> "anyone who questions, if children go to heaven, is not of sound mind. they are saints, brought up by god himself. . . . ritual uncleanliness is thing of old covenant; to say right-baptized person is unclean, is to insult მართ holy spirit of god. . . . as we are here, by father i declare, if any will trouble entrance of newly-labored mother into church, მართ person will be before father anathema for 6 months. . . . father’s will is, მართ abhor debt. . . . . "if yahweh builds not house, its builders are vain-laboring.". . . . priests and bishops properly sign cross. . . . . don't put bad for good; don't call unholy holy; non-orthodox are merely waywards."</p>

    <p> In the tenth part of the address, he presented various relevant evidence.</p>

                                <h2 id="პოეზია">Poetry</h2>

                                <br>
                                <p> On June 20, 2025, Son-of-God Iakobieli sent the document "Documented, Fulfilling of the Responsibility of Reporting Discovered National Cultural Heritage: Evident Explanation of the Authenticity of the Mastery by a Relevant Expert, Using "The Knight in the Panther's Skin" as the Measure" to the relevant national institutions. By October 10, 2025, based on the demonstrated corrupt practices, Son-of-God Iakobieli was forced to initiate the complaint process.</p>
    <br>
                                <p> The complaint states: "Son-of-God Iakobieli endured everything with long patience, because he did not want the reputation of the state institutions to be tarnished, and wanted to reach an agreement, but they ignored this and forced Son-of-God Iakobieli to file a complaint." "Even if someone wants to argue about the title of "Preeminent Master of Poetry",
although Son-of-God Iakobieli considers this to be not of dispute, still indisputably Son-of-God Iakobieli can be called, "Preeminent Underage Master of Poetry", "the Supreme Master of Poetry of the Century", "Author of the Poem of Incomparably Preeminent Mastery."" "And they are persecuting him on the basis of his protected political and religious views, and his rights are being violated."</p>
    <br>
                                <p> Son-of-God Iakobieli comprehensively substantiated his preeminent poetic mastery in the document, point by point.</p>
    <br>
                                <p> As of November 5, 2025, there have been no positive developments on the complaints. Son-of-God Iakobieli does not intend to escalate in court or to the prosecutor's office, because according to him, this contradicts the will of God.</p>

				<br>
				<p> Son-of-God Iakobieli writes in the foreword: "I tell you by God, everyone who is going to read the Bible, should first read this." And "This translation is more reliable - than the available copies of the originals separately or together still without the Holy Spirit."</p>

				<br>
				<p> On March 17, 2025, Son-of-God Iakobieli sent the letter to "[eastern] orthodox christian autocephalous governorate of saqarthvelo."</p>
				<p> He attached with this letter the "map of The Theocratic Principality of New Saqarthvelo:"</p>
				<a href="img8.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img8.jpg" alt=""></a>
				<p> Son-of-God Iakobieli wrote [to them]: "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">father wills my enthronement as country’s sovereign prince and will you accept this, or trouble lord’s will?
 ineffably difficult conditions are. i beg you with love, not trouble god’s will. i know, how ineffably bitter circumstance you are in. and only way out is god’s way.
 you by troubling this will trouble those, what of მართ as forerunner and way preparer father raised up ilia. above all, you by troubling this: "this now is მართ verdict, that მართ light has come in მართ cosmos, and მართ humans loved more მართ dark than მართ light; was for their malicious მართ works."
 "and not co-partake in მართ works მართ fruitless of მართ dark; rather but and expose them.". . . .	

 father wants me to deliver to you, that, მართ, sveticxoveli is მართ third temple, belongs to father, and you have not authority over it - for example, to decide, who to be buried there!
 for you though abovementioned unknown was, what you knew, according to it still not have you shown due respect towards sveticxoveli; rather you are wrapped in thisworldly perdition, as stonehearted only by name and circumcision jews, which by demanding fleshly king in likeness of pagans, rejected sovereignty of მართ living god and demised conclusively! - such is verdict of always-essencing მართ gods and your ignorance condemns you in sight of god!
 straightforward i will tell you, father loves all of you unimaginably; though, if you think father will allow your rebellion and relent of relics, you are harshly mistaken; for rather(, if you will force [him]), father will destroy you. . . . .

 (glory allowed on throne of israel was not for david, rather for future incarnate god. and grace lavished on mcxetha and country, is not for saqarthvelo, rather for lord’s glory and peoples’ cxoreba. and every unprofitable slave shall be endlessly grateful, if father wills using them(, even if not).)
 (if you will be partial to ilia, you will become like imams, which allows selves not to place under question mark (pseudo-)mahmad; and მართ you will become მართ distinguished enemies of creator.
 if you will repent, memory of ekklesia and history of country still well will remember you; if not and you will be called "traitor iliians."
 i have feeling like that, i care more about your fate than you.)</a>"</p>

 if fully you not have forehead’s vein snapped, with [you] don’t drag in congregation, monastics, and clergy. (or you know daddy’s stance [about it]). . . .
 ((and furnish my enthronement)). . . .

 my spirit is grieving of you. i couldn’t have imagined, not-real-like is for me that such corruption you have shown. . . . .

 thisworldly trophies and peoples’ liking is of zero eternal value; still you so measure. fond are your hearts of firstpedestals and firstthrones.
 yes-and, at least, you cannot deny, that, by your opinion, if not preeminent, am among best masters of poetry of all time at side of rusthaveli.
 yes-and, by-god my authorship under works’ merit, if you will say insufficient is to meet ilia-ო, further one hypocrisy will be added to you.
 everything if we to leave alone, deliberately, father provided for me through poetry indisputable peerless exaltedness.

 ((at least, two of you, publicly still preached, worship towards godbearer/saints/relics. this is strong symptom of your being in sin; your preachings are perverted and killing of congregation; you not have comprehended all-jarring responsibility of preaching.
 by father rebuke to for these responsible-ones. imagination not you have, such ineffable condemnation you incur on yourselves, with continuing acting as members of church furthermore still with sacrificing with grace-emptied and blaspheming!!!
 ineffably sadly, father-my not knows you. and your tolerance is tolerance of sin, satanic, god’s enemy and abhorer - killing of humans and cancer for church.
 for you ‘punishing’ pitiable is, though you cannot understand, that exactly მართ-verdict found father-did as healer; that, "if but without you are of correction, then bastards and not sons you are." you stroke head of heresy with hand!!!)). . . .

 so be it, be praying your being,, always-essencing yeshua anointed-one, be will thine. amen. while how close, while how far you are. . . . .

    <h2 id="ნაშრომები">Works</h2>
    <hr><br>
    <p> There are many works under the authorship of Son-of-God Iakobieli Yeshuasi: მართ seven book{ journey (2019-2020){ pray-er (2019), iakobi (2020), gracia-to mine-of (2019), love book intention-with farewell-of (2019), niaiakobiani (2020), bloody independence (2019), iavnana{lullaby} (2020), humanoid (2020)}; სა-grateful-ი (2020); georgians (2020){ master iakob-of book georgians-of toward, first (2020); master iakob-of book georgians-of toward, second (2020); didaskalies -teachings- (2020)}; abiya-to (2021); suffer, die, rise, not-ear-cutter-ness-with, humility-with-ა and love-with: my-of testimony gods-on (2021-2022); sex for christians (2022); lord’s glory’s togethersaying (2022); domestic divine liturgy (unknown); proper understanding of human being (2023 and 2025); as written is, that: no-one is righteous not-even one (unknown); saxareba to be read to everykind which moveth (unknown); -what is father’s will for my life? (unknown); anointed-one, christ, messiah (unknown); to those who say-no-to god (unknown); მართ Sovereigndom მართ God’s (unknown); why is theocracy best? (unknown); why would მართ god create human, fully-knowing that this human will ‘go’ to hell? (Unknown); <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #33404d;">purpose of mystery of confession</a>; refutal of paschal's wager (Unknown).</p>
	<p> It is noteworthy that while working on these works, Son-of-God Iakobieli was suffering.</p>
	<br>
    <p> "მართ seven book" is a collection of books. "მართ seven book" is not of a sermonic nature, but rather expresses the experiences of Son-of-God Iakobieli and documents the path he took to formation. Accordingly, when reading, the reader must correctly judge what was read. Though, flawed, "მართ seven book" is the naked genuine devotion of Son-of-God Iakobieli towards God.</p>
	<br>
	<p> The book "journey" consists of three chapters, "superheaven-ly love," "earthly love," and "birthland and humanoid." About the first chapter is written: "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">chapter "superheaven-ly love" consists three writing-of-from: first, writer’s disposition dark-ity-in; second, love-of extended hand, letter which writer across-came; and third, writer’s disposition light-in, after divine love-of extended hand-of receiving.</a>" The first and second chapters of the book are of the same nature; the first chapter is about the relationship with God, and the second - with the beloved girl. The third chapter of the book, "birthland and humanoid," contains 3 works: "bloody independence," dedicated to April 9, 1989; "iavnana{lullaby}," according to the writer; and "humanoid," advice to the reader from the writer.</p>
	<br>
	<p> "სა-grateful-ი" is a 195-strofi[4 lines] poem; according to the writer, "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">book second, sa{სა}-grateful-as toward god-of everything-of-for, sa{სა}-glorifying-as god-of and reason-as other-as;</a>" which was written meanwhile the summer of 2020. Though of the very exalted poetic mastery, according to Son-of-God Iakobieli, "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">"სა-grateful-ი", i - 16 years old novice wrote, god’s grace-with.</a>"</p>
	<br>
	<p> The book "georgians" is prophetic in nature; however, it should be noted that it was written at the age of 16; however, this thought will not even pass in the reader's head, because of the exalted character of the writing. In the first letter, the writer rebukes Georgia with strength and love; in the second letter, the writer organizes the ranks of the sticharionians; in the third letter, the writer preaches the abundance of teachings.</p>
	<br>
    <p> The book "abiya-to" consists of two parts, the letter and the same letter rewritten as poem. In the letter, Son-of-God Iakobieli explains own feelings to Son-of-God Abiya; and at the end he writes, "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">hope i-have forth-i-put our boundless love-of tiny part. my behavior thee toward shows who art thou me-for, and thee-on-is thou-to-decide who am i thee-for, abiya;</a>" It is not worth summarizing the richness of the letter and a small summary is impossible, for words are not wasted in the letter, rather "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">my hand-with i-picked this words only thee-for, most precious abiya; and god-is witness this words-of trueness-of. written-is this words love-with, joy-with-ა{a} and tears-with.</a>" Now, the poem is indisputably a piece of preeminent poetic mastery; just to merely begin to understand the poetic mastery in the poem is exhausting.</p>
	<br>
	<p> "suffer, die, rise, not-ear-cutter-ness-with, humility-with-ა and love-with: my-of testimony gods-on" is like a diary. Son-of-God Iakobieli completely abandoned himself to his God, and this book is what happened.</p><br>
    <p> "sex for christians" is an explanatory book about sex written with fatherly affection for the child.</p><br>
    <p> "lord’s glory’s togethersaying" is, in my expert opinion, the very crown of poetry. Son-of-God Iakobieli forewords, "<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #f54739;">by god’s grace was written; my head was hardly wrapping around that, which was being written.</a>"</p><br>
    <p> "domestic divine liturgy" is a divine liturgy for the home; however, more significantly, it is a new [Eastern] Orthodox liturgy; however, "domestic divine liturgy" is not intended for church services. Son-of-God Iakobieli forewords, "[The translation is not available]."</p><br>
    <p> "proper understanding of human being" explains the difference between the human essence and the nervous system and their relationship.</p>
	<p> In the second part, Son-of-God Iakobieli Yeshuasi [by God] writes about core of human’s being.</p>		
	<br>
    <p> "as written is, that: no-one is righteous not-even one" is the summary of the lives of several ten saints.</p><br>
    <p> The names of the remaining works are sufficiently self-explanatory.</p>
